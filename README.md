## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Continuous Voice Listening** 🎧
Nemo is always ready, continuously listening for your voice commands. Once activated by the wake word "**Nemo**" followed by your command, it performs the requested task. This makes it a **real-time** voice assistant, ensuring it only listens when you need it to.

### 2. **Speech Interruption Control** 🛑
If Nemo is speaking and you want it to stop, you can simply say commands like "**hold**", "**wait**", or "**stop**" to instantly pause or stop its speech. This gives you full control over conversations and interactions, without needing to wait for it to finish speaking.

### 3. **Memory Storage** 🧠
Nemo has a built-in memory system. You can tell it to **remember** specific pieces of information by saying "add in your memory" or "save in your memory". These conversations are stored in a **JSON file**, allowing Nemo to recall them whenever needed.

Example:  
*Nemo, my lucky number is 18. Save it in your memory.*

### 4. **Lightweight and Background-Friendly** 💻
This program is incredibly lightweight, meaning you can keep it running in the background without any performance issues. Nemo uses **Google's Speech Recognition** system for voice commands and **SAPI5** for speech synthesis on Windows.
